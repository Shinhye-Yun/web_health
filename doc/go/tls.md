### conn.Close()
The defer conn.Close() statement in Go is a common pattern used to ensure that a connection is properly closed when a function exits. Here's an explanation of how it works and why it's useful:

    Purpose:
        It ensures that the connection is closed regardless of how the function exits (normally or due to an error).
        It helps prevent resource leaks by guaranteeing that connections are closed.
    How it works:
        The defer keyword postpones the execution of conn.Close() until the surrounding function returns.
        It's typically placed immediately after successfully opening a connection.
